### Hi!

My name is Jiahe Feng, and my preferred name is Jeffrey. I am a third-year student at the University of California San Diego, majoring in data science and cognitive science and minoring in Japanese studies with a 3.9 GPA. I have worked as a research assistant and an undergraduate tutor at UCSD. I am experienced in data engineering, machine learning, and communicating data analysis, and I am motivated to apply these skills to solve problems in various domains and make positive impacts in the world.

### Background

I was born in Jiangsu, China. In 2014, I came to the United States to attend the Academy of the New Church, a private high school in suburban Philadelphia. In fall 2018, I came to  UCSD with a major in Cognitive Science specialized in machine learning and neural computation, and soon I picked up the data science major as well. I am expecting to graduate in March 2022.
