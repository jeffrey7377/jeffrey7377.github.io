# Data analysis projects

A few of the data analysis projects for practice that I have done at UCSD; There are other data science projects that I made that are not included in the github repository;

The link to these projects can be found here: [Practicenin-data-analysis-projects](https://github.com/jeffrey7377/practice-in-data-analysis-projects)

## Project 3: Snapchat Political Advertisement Analysis (2020)

- The datasets come from https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/.
- Performed EDA, data imputation, and data wrangling on Snapchat political advertisement data in 2018;
- Created data modeling pipelines to predict the number of user impressions for advertisers using the scikit-learn library.
- Evaluated the models and created a comprehensive report with codes to communicate meaningful results.

## Project 2: Beijing PM2.5 Linear Regression (2020)

- Predict the amount of PM2.5 concentration at Beijing given date and weather variables; Practice of data visualization and feature selection;
- Final Report of this project: https://github.com/jeffrey7377/Data_analysis_projects/blob/main/Beijing_pm25_linear_regression/Final_Report.pdf

## Project 1: cardiovascular_disease_project (2019)

- Final project for COGS 108 Data science in practice in fall 2019. A data analysis and classfication project on the data of cardiovascular disease.
- In this project, we analyzed data of patients who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease to further understand the causes of cardiovascular disease as well as to develop an algorithm that is able to non-invasively predict and predict and diagnose such conditions. First, we explored and visualized the distributions of different features in the dataset, including age, BMI, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure. Secondly, we evaluate and compare different classifiers (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Principle Component Analysis, and Support Vector Machines) and identify which is best able to predict cardiovascular disease in this dataset.
