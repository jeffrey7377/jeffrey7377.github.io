### Effects of Climate Change in California

A data visualization project hosted on Github to show the rise of temperature and the effect of climate change in CA. We used Javascript and the Highchart library to create interactive charts that users can manipulate. The goal was to create user-centered designs that help viewers easily understand the severity of global warming.

This visualization page can be found here:
